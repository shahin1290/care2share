Feature: User can see the campaigns on index page

    As a User
    In order to know which campaigns I can donate to
    I would like to see a list of available campaigns on the index page
    
    Scenario: User can see the campaigns on index page
        Given the following campaigns exists
        | title        | description                      | amount_raised |
        |Brain surgery | I grew up always helping others. | 1000.00       |
     
        When I visit the site
        Then I should see "Brain surgery"
        And I should see "I grew up always helping others."
        And I should see "1000"
